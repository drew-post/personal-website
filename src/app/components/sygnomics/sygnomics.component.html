               During my Summer 2021 internship, a team of fourteen Chicago, Seattle, and Houston interns from Slalom Build worked on the internship program's first client facing project for a client called Sygnomics. Sygnomics is a startup that has created a machine learning algorithm (SYGNAL) which provides oncologists with information about a patient's cancer as well as possible options for their treatment. The problem that they came to Slalom Build to solve involved creating a user interface to better display insights from the algorithm to oncologists in an easy and intuitive way.<br><br>

               Our solution was a SYGNAL prototype that allowed an oncologist to create an account, log in, view a list of their patients in a patient portal, and view a detailed dashboard of information about each patient that includes specifics from the SYGNAL algorithm. This involved building endpoints that would grab patient, oncologist, and therapy information from a mock database and sending it to our frontend UI, which we built to display key information to the user. I worked fullstack on this project, first establishing these endpoints and then building some of the frontend components of the UI towards the end of the engagement.<br><br>
               
               This project allowed me to experience for the first time what it's like to collaborate as a team with a client to build a product that best suits their needs. Not only did this internship build my confidence as a new engineer, but it taught me what it means to put continuous delivery in practice as a client better understands their product and message.
