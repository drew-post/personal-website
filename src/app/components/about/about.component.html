                <p>Growing up, I was always very involved in and curious about technology on a user experience level, and I've always enjoyed problem solving. After taking an Intro to Computer Science class in high school, I became further interested in the creative processes involved in software development, as well as how software can become an applicable solution to real life issues. This led me to pursue CS in college, and I've recently graduated Summa Cum Laude from <b class="about__bold">Texas State University</b> with a <b class="about__bold">major in Computer Science and a minor in Media Studies</b>. <br><br>I now work full time as a <b class="about__bold">Software Engineer at <a class="about__link" href="https://www.slalombuild.com/" target="_blank">Slalom Build</a></b>, where I focus on implementing outcome oriented software solutions in highly skilled teams for a diverse set of clients. Some examples of tech stacks I have worked with at _Build include <b class="about__bold">React, Angular,</b> and <b class="about__bold">SwiftUI</b>. Throughout my work, I constantly strive to collaborate, learn new things and grow my skillset overall. Additionally, I'm driven to use best practices in all aspects of my career. On top of my more technical career interests, I enjoy critically consuming and engaging with different types of media, and I seek to bring those skills into aspects of my work and broader life experiences. <br><br>In my free time, I like to thrift, read, travel, and drink coffee.</p>
