               Welcome to my personal website porfolio! I started this project in 2022 as a way to explore more creative
               ways to use Angular, HTML, and CSS. I'm using Angular specifically to implement routes and lazy loading, I'm using
               Canva for some of the graphics, such as the homepage, and I'm using Github pages to host the website on Github.
               By managing this project, I'm hoping to continue to learn and iterate on coding best practices as well as experiment with
               design in a contained way.<br><br>
               Some next steps and improvements I want to make include building out existing/new project pages,
               further optimizing the way the website handles comoponents/component structure,
               potentially enhancing image quality/GIF quality,
               adding animations, and continuing to come up with new, creative ideas for pages on the website.
               <br><br>
               Thank you for visiting!
